## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
In order to compare the performance of the MechaCar against the competition, we need to address a few observables which would be of interest to our customers. These variables will be cost, city and highway fuel efficiency, horsepower, safety rating, and carbon waste output.

We will be testing whether or not the MechaCar has statistically significant differences in these metrics compared to competing models. The null hypothesis will be that these observables don't vary significantly from the competition, and the alternative hypothesis will be that the MechaCar does indeed vary significantly in these variables compared to the competition.

We will perform one-tailed t-tests in order to determine if the MechaCar has higher or lower observed values in these variables than the competition according to which direction the consumer would prefer. The consumer would want the cost to be lower, the city and highway fuel efficiency to be higher, the horsepower to be higher, the safety rating to be higher, and the carbon waste output to be lower.

In order to run these statistical tests, we would need the cost, fuel efficiency, horsepower, safety rating, and carbon waste output data from the MechaCar as well as the MechaCar's competitors.
